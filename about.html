            <p id="introduction">My name is Angelica Perez and I am currently enrolled in Lambda School to become a edtech web developer. Prior to enrolling in Lambda School, I taught third grade for three years and fourth grade for one year. I am currently a fulltime online English as a Second Language teacher for VIPKID. My passion for education began when I was an education while my passion for web development was just recently sparked. I am excited to bring my two passions together in the future and will post projects I have completed while attending Lambda School in this portfolio. I will also update this portfolio regularly as I learn new skills and create new products.</p>
